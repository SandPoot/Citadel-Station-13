  - bugfix: Sylvan should actually be speakable for those who have taken that language
      as roundstart now, and for plantpeople who naturally start with it.
  - bugfix: The langauge Neo-kanji's shortcut was overlapping with the slime language,
      and has been relocated from k to j.
  - bugfix: The langauge Dwarvish's shortcut was potentially overlapping with drones,
      and has been relocated from D to w.
  - bugfix: The language Rachnidian's shortcut was getting in the way of the Ratvarian
      language, so it's been moved from r to c.
